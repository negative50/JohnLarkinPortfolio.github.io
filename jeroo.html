		<p><h2>Jeroo 1</h2>
		In this section, we learned about the very basics of Jeroo. For example, how to move forward, turn, pick flower, toss flowers,
		and how to use them to make the Jeroo do stuff. We completed basic labs, which usually was limited to basic functions such as 
		creating a diamond shape, picking up flowers and planting them over and over, and avoiding nets. In the next sections we would then learn
		what we could do to avoid having to copy and paste a lot of code over and over again.

		<h2>Jeroo 2</h2>
		Within this chapter of our Jeroo learning experience, we were taught how to create Jeroo methods to use to
		shorten what would be very long code created using a lot of copy and pasting. Although this would lead to a lot
		of copying and pasting of the methods. Which would then be solved once we learn of loops in the next sections.

		<h2>Jeroo 3</h2>
		From here, we learned how to use "while(condition)" statements to limit actions until that condition is no longer met,
		and we learned how to use "if(condition)" statements to cause certain actions to happen when that condition is met. However, 
		a big difference between while and if statements is that if statements are checked once to see if they are true, and only perform that action once.
		while statements keep on doing what is listed within them until their condition is no longer met.

		<h2>Jeroo 4</h2>
		Jeroo 4 is just an expansion on the previous topics intended to get us to use what we learned
		in creative ways to solve problems. We also learned how to use "else if(condition)" statements.
		We also used loops in order to reduce the amount of copying and pasting however, this would often lead
		to the issue of the loop not stopping, and for me, that was the hardest part. Trying to make the loop end that
		is.

		<p>Jeroo is the second platform we used to understand and learn about programming right after Scratch.
		It is an award winning program that teache coding through the use of basic commands, for example hop, pick,
		toss, turn, to control entities within the program called Jeroos. vvv this is what I think a Jeroo looks like. vvv</p>
