		<p>-This is the very first project we did with Scratch. It is the name project and we had 
		to design a program that would animate our name. We had to make sure that there were atleast 3
		unique behaviors that the letters would have.<p>
		<p>Concepts Learned: We learned the basics of Scratch. For examples, the event blocks, which are the most important,
		we learned how to use those. And we learned how to use "if-then" blocks, "when this is pressed", and other kinds of basics
		blocks that allow for the simple act of moving from one side to the screen, rotating around, changing colors, and growing in size.
		We were even able to apply these concepts to the background so we could control the background and do something similar as well.</p>
