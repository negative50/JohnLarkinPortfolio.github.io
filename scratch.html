		<p>-This is the very first project we did with Scratch. It is the name project and we had 
		to design a program that would animate our name. We had to make sure that there were atleast 3
		unique behaviors that the letters would have.<p>
		<p>Concepts Learned: We learned the basics of Scratch. For examples, the event blocks, which are the most important,
		we learned how to use those. And we learned how to use "if-then" blocks, "when this is pressed", and other kinds of basics
		blocks that allow for the simple act of moving from one side to the screen, rotating around, changing colors, and growing in size.
		We were even able to apply these concepts to the background so we could control the background and do something similar as well.</p>

		<p>-This project was our computer buying project. In this project we had to use Scratch to create a presentation.<p>
		<p>Concepts Learned: We learned how to apply the previous blocks we learned in a creative way in order to create a
		presentation.We got a lot of practice using forever loops, and "if-then" statements. </p>

		<p>For the final project, I did a simple story incorporating "if-then" statements, broadcasts, functions that cause characters
		to "say" stuff, and variables to control the order in which the story is performed.</p>
		<p>Concepts Learned: I learned how to use variables in a new way in order to effectively control the progression of the story.
		I practiced using broadcasts in turn with the variable system I set up in order to trigger a series of events that would change backgrounds and reposition characters.</p>
