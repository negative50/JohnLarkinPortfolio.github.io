		<p><h2>Python Unit 1</h2>
		This was the very first unit we did in python where we learned the very basics. For example,
		we learned how to print text, do math and print the answer, and be able to create variables.
		We also learned about classes and methods and what those terms mean and how they are used within
		python to program. Lastly, we learned how to ask a question and recieve an input from the user to
		be used within the program. We did labs which practiced those concepts, and one of the labs we did
		, the basics_moving_lab, in which we created a character and were able to move the character around.

		<h2>Python Unit 2</h2>
		In this unit, we learned how to use Ifs, If-elses, and If-elifs. Those work exactly how they did in jeroo, where
		for an if statement, the program would check if the requirements are met once and fulfill whatever the if statement contains
		if it is satisfied and then move on with the rest of the program. If-elses, are if statements that the program will only check if 
		the very first if statement's requirements have not been met.
		If-elifs work very similarily to the previous statement but come with a condition that needs to be met in order to execute its code.
		One of the labs we did this unit was recreate the previous lab that we did in order to move a sprite, but we added the ability to collide into other 
		objects and making moving in that directio impossible while colliding.

		<h2>Python Unit 3</h2>
		In this unit, we went over how to integrat loops into our code. We learned how to create loops that only repeat a certain number of times
		using ranges, and we learned how to create while loops that repeat for as long as its condition is met. Also, at the end we learned how to generate
		random numbers within a range. Loops are handy for if we wanted to generate a series of objects, or keep something in motion without having to constantly type out
		the same code repeatedly. We used this in the ground runner lab to create a timer that will count down in seconds, and generate coins in random spots 
		around the area.

		<h2>Python Unit 4</h2>
		This unit was focused on creating lists and calling things from that list of stuff. This is handy for wanting to generate
		objects using loops which will reduce a lot of code writing. We used it in the lab Costume runner and dodge runner to change
		the characters sprite depending on which direction he was moving in, and we also used it to create enemies that would end the game
		if the character were to come into contact with them.
