		<h1>My Favorite Movie(s)</h1>
		<p> This is a tough decision between "American Ultra" and "Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World".
		I would just call it a tie and say both are my favorite.

		</p>
		<p>
		<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446029/">Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World </a>
		</p>
		<p> I like "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World" a lot because I respect the director, Edgar Wright,who made that movie because he
		also made "Hot Fuzz" and "Shaun of the Dead". I also have been reading the visual novel series which the movie was created from
		and I just thought that this movie portrayed the visual novel well and did so in a way that felt original and creative.
		</p>
		<p> I like "American Ultra" not because it was a good movie, because it wasn't really, but I just liked the concept of the movie
		and the aesthetic of it.

		<h1>Favorite Actor</h1>
		<head> I think, if I had to choose a favorite actor, which I can't but I'll pick someone anyways, then it would have to be Robin Williams. </head>

		<p> Robin Williams is a hugely iconic actor that has been part of many people's childhoods from movies like "Jumanji", "Robots", "Good Morning, Vietnam", and "Aladdin".
		He's like the uncle we've always had.</p>
